      <p>
        Elon Musk and his brother started Zip2, a software company, in 1995. In
        1999 he sold it and became a millionaire. He then started X.com, which
        merged with the company Confinity to make PayPal. X.com was then renamed
        to PayPal, and he focused on growing that part of the company.[5][6] He
        then started SpaceX and became the CEO of Tesla. He has Asperger
        syndrome. Musk was born to a Canadian mother and a South African-born
        British father in Pretoria, South Africa.[7] His parents divorced in
        1980 and he mainly lived with his father in many different places in
        South Africa.[8] He went to Waterkloof House Preparatory School and
        graduated from Pretoria Boys High School. He then moved to Canada in
        1988 when he was 17 after he obtained Canadian citizenship through his
        mother. He got it before his South African military service was to
        begin. He felt that it would be easier to immigrate into the United
        States from Canada than from South Africa.
